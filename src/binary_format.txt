libckey Binary Format
=====================

Preliminaries
-------------
All integer values are network byte order.

Strings are encoded as a two byte integer indicating the length of the string,
followed by that number of bytes representing the string.

File header
-----------

Each file starts with a 4 byte identifier. These bytes are the letters C, K, E,
and Y (43h, 4Bh, 45h and 59h).

After the identifier, the version number is included. The version is a 4 byte
integer.

Data block (v0)
---------------

The data block consists of consequtive data nodes. Each node consists of a two
bytes inidicating the node type, followed by node specific data. Each file
must contain a "Best map" node. The "Best map" node should precede all "Map
start" nodes. Below is a list of all the known nodes and their formats (code
in hex):

Name         | Code | Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best map     | 0    | A string with the name of the best map
Map start    | 1    | A string with the name of the map that follows
Key value    | 2    | Two strings, one for the key, one for the value
Key terminfo | 3    | Two strings, one for the key, one for the terminfo key
End of file  | FFFF | None
