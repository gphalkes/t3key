Introduction
============

The ckey project was born from the desire to use all key combinations provided
by terminals and terminal emulators in console applications. The terminfo
database only provides a very limited set of key sequences, and even fewer key
sequences for modifier/key combinations. Most applications wishing to use
specific combinations as shortcuts have resorted to maintaining a private set
of mappings for the key-combinations used within the application. This
situation is obviously far from optimal.


Goals
=====

The ckey project aims to build a database of key combinations with their
respective key sequences for all terminals. By providing an easy to use API to
access the database, all console applications should be able to benefit from
this effort. Furthermore, the database does not depend on any other terminal
information library (such as terminfo or termcap), and as such is usable in all
console application projects.
