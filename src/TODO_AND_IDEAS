Grammar of ASCII files
======================
data:
	keyvalue
|
	identifier '{'
		keyvalue+
	'}'
;

keyvalue:
	identifier '=' [ identifier | string ]
;

Binary files
============
binary files are simply binary representations of above structure with size
prefixes and without comments etc. Strings are saved as <length><bytes>


keymaps can easily be composed by inclusion and overriding.

Special keywords:
%best -> denotes which keymap
%start -> denotes either terminfo entry or escape seq to enable this keymap
%leave -> denotes either terminfo entry or escape seq to disable this keymap
%include -> include other keymap (with start enabled!)

multiple start and leave keywords are allowed
keys can be followed by #[cms]+ to indicate modifier states

Key names definitions follow PC style keyboard:
home -> start of line
end -> end of line
insert -> insert key
etc.
