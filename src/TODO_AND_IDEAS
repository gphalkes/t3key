TODO
====
- implement %aka keys
- location of database directory should be configurable through environment
  and the user's home directory should also be searched
- database version retrieval through API?

- omit keys with standard mappings such as \t for tab
- switch to X session with only the terminal emulator running to capture as many
  key sequences as possible
- what do we do with duplicates? It's not always possible to say which is the
  "original" and which is the actual duplicate. This is partly a job for the
  database creator to only include the ones that are sensible. In principle
  we should only have one key symbol return a particular sequence, because
  otherwise the program using libckey can't figure out what to do and results
  may depend on the comparison order.
- function to read key from fd/FILE with translation (and UTF-8 decoding?)


- make documentation:
	- curses dependency for fallback and control sequences (terminfo only!)
	- list of key names
	- special key names %enter %leave
	- name format for maps only included in others

- make the database independant of the terminfo library. This means removing it
  from the binary format as well as removing library support for looking up
  strings from the terminfo database and removing grammar constructs for the
  ascii format.


FIXME: add documentation on how to use, with remark not to make a distinction
between keypad and non-keypad keys because they may give the same keycode
