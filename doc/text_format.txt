libt3key Text Format
====================

Preliminaries
-------------

Strings are stored as text delimted by double quotes, and with backslash
escaping. Keys start with either a letter (upper- or lowercase) or an
underscore. Second and later key characters can be a letter, a number or an
underscore. Modifiers are appended to keys by adding an at sign (+) followed
by one or more of the letters c, m and s (in that order, for control, meta
and shift respectively).

Any characters after a hash (#) character that is not part of a string up to
the end of the line are considered comments and are ignored.

Maps
----

A map is defined by a key followed by an open brace, a set of key-value pair
and finaly a closing brace. The key-value pairs in the map are specified as
key = value. The permissable keys consist of the special keys %include, %enter
and %leave, and the names for the different keys on the keyboard (as specified
in a later section).

The %include special key can be used to include the key-value pairs of the
named map into the current map. The value for %include should be the name of a
key, without quotes. %enter and %leave keys will be ignored in the included
map. Maps whose name begins with and underscore will be omitted from the
output and can be used to define shared mappings without making directly
accessible maps.

The %enter key defines the string to send to the terminal to switch the
terminal to the mode for which this map defines the keys. The %leave key
defines the string to reset the terminal to its original state. For the %enter
and %leave keys, the value can be either a (unquoted) terminfo name or a
string.

Normal keys should have a string as their value. If a non-keypad and a keypad
key share both function and string, only the non-keypad key should be included.

Best map
--------

The "best map", as indicated by the %best key, should indicate the map that
gives access to the most useful set of key mappings. What "most useful" means
is unfortunately not easy to define. Being able to distinghuish between as
many combinations of keys and modifiers is of course desirable, but not always
the only consideration.

The value associated with the %best key is the unquoted name of a map defined
in the file. The %best key should be defined outside any map and is mandatory.

Also Known As
-------------

Many maps are shared by different terminals. By including a %aka key, these
shared maps can be included under different names. The practical implementation
is that a (symbolic) link will be created from the original name to the name
specified in the %aka key.

The value associated with an %aka key should be a string containing an
additional name under which this map should be known.
